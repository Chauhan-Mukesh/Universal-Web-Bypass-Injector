## 🔧 How It Works

The extension uses several advanced techniques to provide comprehensive protection:

### 1. **Network Request Interception**
- Patches `fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest` at the protocol level
- Blocks tracking requests before they leave your browser
- Maintains allow-lists for legitimate content

### 2. **Intelligent DOM Cleaning**
- Removes tracking elements and overlays from web pages
- Uses smart selectors to avoid breaking legitimate content
- Handles dynamically loaded content via MutationObserver

### 3. **CSS Functionality Restoration**
- Fixes page styling issues caused by restrictive websites
- Restores scrolling and interaction capabilities
- Removes visual restrictions without breaking layout

### 4. **Real-time Monitoring**
- Continuously watches for new tracking elements
- Debounced cleanup to minimize performance impact
- Automatic adaptation to new blocking attempts

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working?
1. **Check Extension Status**:
   - Verify extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
   - Look for any error badges on the extension icon
   - Check the popup shows "Active and protecting this page"

2. **Refresh Current Page**:
   - Hard refresh with `Ctrl+F5` (Mac: `Cmd+Shift+R`)
   - Clear browser cache if issues persist
   - Try opening the page in an incognito window

3. **Check Console for Errors**:
   - Open Developer Tools (`F12`)
   - Look for extension-related errors in console
   - Report any errors with specific website URLs

### Site Still Showing Ads/Paywalls?
1. **Advanced Blocking Techniques**: Some sites use sophisticated detection methods
2. **Manual Re-application**: Click "Re-apply" button in popup
3. **Report Issues**: Submit issues with specific website URLs for investigation
4. **Temporary Workaround**: Use context menu "Bypass restrictions on this page"

### Performance Issues?
1. **Extension Conflicts**: Disable other ad-blockers to identify conflicts
2. **Memory Usage**: Monitor in `chrome://system/` if experiencing slowdowns
3. **Reset Extension**: Disable and re-enable the extension
4. **Browser Restart**: Restart Chrome to clear any memory leaks

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode for detailed logging:
1. Open extension popup
2. Hold `Shift` and click the version number 5 times
3. Debug logs will appear in console with `🛡️ UWB:` prefix
