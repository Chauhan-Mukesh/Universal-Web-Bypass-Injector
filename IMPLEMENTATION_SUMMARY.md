### 4. Firewall and Network Requirements Identified
- ✅ GitHub services: `github.com`, `api.github.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`
- ✅ NPM registry: `registry.npmjs.org`, `www.npmjs.com`
- ✅ Browser services: `dl.google.com`, `playwright.azureedge.net`
- ✅ CI/CD services: `codecov.io`, `coveralls.io`
- ✅ CDN services: `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `unpkg.com`, `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`

### 5. Testing and Validation
- ✅ All existing Jest tests passing
- ✅ Linting clean with no errors
- ✅ Browser automation script working correctly
- ✅ Extension building and loading capability verified
- ✅ Separate test environments for Jest and Playwright
