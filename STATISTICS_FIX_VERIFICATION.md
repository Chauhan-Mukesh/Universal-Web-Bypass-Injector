# Testing the Statistics Page Fix

## Problem Resolved
The issue "Click to view detailed statistics" leading to `ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` has been fixed.

## Root Cause
The `statistics.html` and `statistics.js` files were missing from the build process:
- Build script `INCLUDE_FILES` array did not include these files
- Production optimization script did not process `statistics.js`
- Package validation did not check for these files

## Solution Applied
1. **Build Script Fix**: Added `statistics.html` and `statistics.js` to `INCLUDE_FILES` in `scripts/build-extension.js`
2. **Production Optimization**: Added `statistics.js` to production optimization process
3. **Package Validation**: Updated package validation to check for statistics files

## Verification Steps
1. Run `npm run build:extension` - verify statistics files are copied
2. Run `npm run package:production` - verify statistics files are in ZIP
3. Load extension in Chrome and click "Click to view detailed statistics"
4. Verify statistics page opens without ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND

## Manual Testing
To test the fix manually:
1. Load the extension in Chrome (developer mode)
2. Click the extension icon to open popup
3. Click on the statistics section
4. Click "ðŸ“Š Click to view detailed statistics"
5. Statistics page should open in a new tab without errors

## Files Modified
- `scripts/build-extension.js` - Added statistics files to build process
- `scripts/package-extension.js` - Added statistics files to validation
- Various other enhancements for ad blocking and content handling

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Build and verify
npm run build:extension
ls dist/ | grep statistics

# Package and verify  
npm run package:production
unzip -l packages/*.zip | grep statistics

# Full validation
npm run validate
```
