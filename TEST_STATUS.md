## Recently Fixed Issues
All previously skipped tests have been successfully enabled and are now passing:

### ✅ Fixed: Quality Gate ESLint Configuration (Latest)
- **Issue**: ESLint was scanning generated coverage files causing quality gate failures
- **Root Cause**: `coverage/**` directory was not excluded in eslint.config.js
- **Solution**: Added `coverage/**` to ESLint ignore patterns
- **Impact**: Eliminated hundreds of linting violations from generated coverage report files
- **Result**: Clean ESLint reports with only actual source code being scanned

### ✅ Fixed: Installation Event Handling
- Improved mock setup for chrome.runtime.getURL
- Enhanced test assertions for notification parameters
- Added proper async handling for installation events

### ✅ Fixed: Welcome Notification Tests
- Fixed notification creation testing
- Added proper mock verification
- Ensured callback function testing works correctly

### ✅ Fixed: Mock Setup Timing
- Improved Chrome API mock initialization
- Fixed background service listener registration
- Enhanced mock factory functions for consistency

## Production Readiness
The extension is **production ready** with comprehensive test coverage:

✅ **Code Quality**: ESLint passes with no errors  
✅ **Manifest Valid**: Chrome extension manifest is correctly structured with enhanced security  
✅ **File Structure**: All required files present and valid  
✅ **JavaScript Syntax**: No syntax errors in any files  
✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: All 135 automated tests passing with **0 skipped**  
✅ **Security Enhanced**: Improved CSP and permission restrictions  
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and usage guides  
✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout codebase  

## Security Improvements
Recent security enhancements applied:

✅ **Enhanced CSP**: Strengthened Content Security Policy with `object-src 'none'`
