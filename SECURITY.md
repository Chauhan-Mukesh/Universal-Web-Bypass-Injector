## 🔧 Security Fixes Applied

### 📋 Recent Security Improvements

#### **Medium Severity Issues Fixed**

##### 1. Overly Permissive Content Security Policy
**Issue**: The original CSP allowed `object-src 'self'` which could potentially be exploited.

**Fix Applied**:
```json
"content_security_policy": {
  "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none';"
}
```

**Security Improvement**:
- Changed `object-src 'self'` to `object-src 'none'` to prevent object/embed injections
- Added `base-uri 'self'` to prevent base tag injections
- Added `frame-ancestors 'none'` to prevent framing attacks

##### 2. Insecure External Connectivity Configuration
**Issue**: The extension allowed connections from both HTTP and HTTPS origins.

**Fix Applied**:
```json
"externally_connectable": {
  "matches": ["https://*/*"]
}
```

**Security Improvement**:
- Removed HTTP support (`http://*/*`) to enforce HTTPS-only connections
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks on insecure connections
- Ensures all external communications are encrypted

#### **Low Severity Issues Fixed**

##### 1. Content Security Policy Enhancement
**Issue**: The CSP lacked comprehensive security directives.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced CSP with additional security directives
- Implemented defense-in-depth security approach
- Added comprehensive frame protection

### 🔒 CI/CD Security Improvements

#### TruffleHog Secret Scanning Fix
**Issue**: Secret scanning failed due to BASE and HEAD commits being identical.

**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented context-aware scanning logic
- Added fallback for single commit scenarios
- Enhanced error handling for different trigger contexts (PR, push, schedule)
- Improved scan coverage without false positives

**Benefits**:
- Reliable secret detection across all CI/CD scenarios
- Prevents accidental secret commits
- Enhanced security monitoring

### 🧪 Security Test Enhancements

#### Fixed Skipped Security Tests
**Issue**: Critical tests were being skipped, reducing security validation coverage.

**Fix Applied**:
- Fixed installation event handling tests
- Enhanced welcome notification security tests
- Improved mock setup for comprehensive testing

**Benefits**:
- 100% test execution (0 skipped tests)
- Enhanced security test coverage
- Better validation of security-critical functionality
